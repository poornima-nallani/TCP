# Ping Pong LAN Game

A two-player real-time Ping Pong game built in C using TCP sockets and multithreading. The game supports synchronized gameplay over a local area network (LAN) with one player acting as a server and the other as a client.

## Features

### Client–Server Architecture
- One player hosts the game as the server.
- The second player connects as the client.

### Real-Time Synchronization
- Paddle positions, ball position, and scores are exchanged between server and client every few milliseconds.
- Smooth and responsive gameplay experience.

### Gameplay Rules
- Players control paddles (left/right movement).
- Ball bounces between paddles.
- If a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point.
